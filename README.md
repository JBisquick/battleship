# odin-battleship

This project is a website for playing battleships.

**Link to Project:** https://jbisquick.github.io/odin-battleship/

# How it's Made:

**Tech Used:** CSS and JavaScript

A multidimensional array was used to create the battleship game. To attack the opponent, the player clicks on one of the spaces. Which causes an event listiner to attack that space and allow the computer to take a turn. The computer attacks a random or calculated space if it is currently attacking a ship. The player, board, and ships were all created using factory functions. All of this is displayed as DOMs on the webpage.

# Lesson's Learned:

This taught me how to make a project using test driven development.
